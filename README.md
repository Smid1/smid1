### ⚡ About Me  
I have just finished High School with Professional Qualification in System Development Technician at Etec de Itaquera, SP. Now I am starting college, where I am going to study Computer Science at Universidade Anhanguera.

I love changing and finding new ways to solve problems that I have found. Learning how to adapt to everything is the best way to deal with life adversities.

Currently, I am doing my best to gain knowledge in various areas, as it is the thing that I do most and feel happier about, especially when it comes to technology.

I have worked before doing a variety of things, however, I am willing to work with technology as soon as possible, as it is where I belong.

### Currently Studying:
